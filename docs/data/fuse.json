We'll be meeting with someone who will tell us the main quest\r\n\r\n## Delivery to Phandalin\r\n- We see 2 horses with black feathers sticking out of it\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Goblin fight</span>\r\n        - We take the last goblin and tie him up, so we can ask it about Gundren and Sildar\r\n        - The Goblin points us in a direction, and *we Short Rest* before going there\r\n- We go in the direction, towards Cragmaw Cave, leaving Korvak behind\r\n\r\n## Cragmaw Cave\r\n- We see remnants of a cart, deducing that Gundren and Sildar were here\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">We fight goblins near the entrance of the cave</span>\r\n- We see wolves chained up\r\n- Erik sneaks past the wolves and sees:\r\n    - Hobgoblin cooking\r\n    - Gundren's provisions\r\n    - More wolves\r\n- We befriend one of the wolves (name her Frizzy) and <span style=\"color:red\">kill the rest</span>\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">We fight the Hobgoblin and his wolves</span>\r\n    - We incapacitate the Hobgoblin and he tells us where Sildar is\r\n    - Pieck kills the Hobgoblin and takes his head\r\n- We go towards Sildar\r\n- We meet another Hobgoblin\r\n    - He offers us Sildar since he give him the other Hobgoblin's head\r\n- **We wake Sildar up and he tells us they took Gundren to Cragmaw Castle**\r\n    - We plan to go to Phandalin to ask if anyone knows where Cragmaw Castle is\r\n\r\n## Phandalin\r\n- We see 40 to 50 log buildings\r\n- Sildar asks us to drop supplies off at Barthen's Provisions\r\n    - Elena Barthen is here and explains our expedition to us...\r\n        - **Apparently, Gundren is the successor of a legendary cave that has infinite treasure**\r\n        - **But no one knows where the cave is, except Gundren claims to have a map to it**\r\n        - Gundren may have been abducted for this knowledge\r\n    - She also recommends we talk to Iarno, the townmaster who helped established the town\r\n- We go to Stone Hill Inn\r\n    - Sildar and Korvak pay for our rooms\r\n    - A patron at the inn says that Iarno is nice and the Redbrand Ruffians (RBRs) have been terrorizing the townspeople\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">We fight some RBRs in the Inn and beat them</span>\r\n        - We ask the last guy who he's working for\r\n        - **As he tries to tell us, he explodes into dust**\r\n    - *We Long Rest*\r\n    - Taryn (the owner of the Inn) tells us that Sildar went to talk to Iarno\r\n    - We go shopping...\r\n- We go to Lionshield Coster\r\n    - Nothing there, the RBRs took everything\r\n    - **The owner, Minghee, tells us that the RBRs are at the Old Owl Well**\r\n    - **Minghee promises us weapons if we get them back from the ruffians**\r\n- We go to Barthen's Provisions\r\n    - We buy potions, caltrops, and rags\r\n- we go to Townmaster's Hall\r\n    - We learn the Iarno used to belong to the Lord's Alliance, a group of powerful people that aims to strengthen small towns\r\n    - **Iarno tells us he'll pay us 100 GP each to deal with the RBRs**\r\n    - **He doesn't know where Cragmaw Castle is, but refers us to a druid at the Ruins of Thunder Tree**\r\n    - We're all generally suspicious of Iarno, ~~so much so that Pieck tried to pickpocket the gold from him and made him mad, so he rescinded the offer~~\r\n\r\n## Old Owl Well\r\n- We see ruins of an old castle\r\n- We trick the guards by saying the RBRs are under attack in Phandalin, so they leave\r\n- Captain of the RBRs comes up to us and allows Pieck and I to come in and see the owl bear\r\n    - Meanwhile, Shadow and Erik are sneaking around\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Captain unleashes owl bear to attack Pieck and I, getting the other RBRs to join the fight</span>\r\n    - Shadow and Erik try to help out\r\n    - We eventually all disengage and befriend the owl bear, baiting him with food\r\n    - We fight again, this time the owl bear fighting the RBRs\r\n    - When I use Tasha's Hideous Laughter on the captain, the grunts flee\r\n    - The grunts who initially left come back and join the combat, eventually losing\r\n    - **Pieck negotiates with the owl bear -- it can join us for one more combat in the campaign**\r\n- **We incapacitate the captain and interrogate him, he tells us:**\r\n    - The weapons are in the well\r\n    - His boss, Glasstaff, is stronger than him\r\n    - His friends explode into dust because they're \"not trusted enough\", but he is\r\n    - Iarno isn't helping them\r\n    - He has over a dozen men in his command\r\n    - The objective of the RBRs is to take over Phandalin, for wealth that was promised to them\r\n    - They stash their gold in the Sleeping Giant\r\n    - He doesn't know who Gundren is\r\n    - Thunder Tree is 1 hour south from here\r\n- **Captain dies before telling us where the secret entrance to the Sleeping Giant is**\r\n    - Owl bear eats him\r\n- **We get 25 GP and a piece of paper from the Captain, that says \"Bring the bag sundown tomorrow. --G\"**\r\n- **We retrieve the bag of Minghee's weapons from the bottom of the well**\r\n\r\n## Back to Phandalin\r\n- Return the weapons to Minghee, then get the rewards\r\n- *We Long Rest at the Inn*\r\n    - We find that Sildar is gone\r\n    - A child named Carp comes in, saying his sister Mirna has been kidnapped by 2 people who then went to Tresendar Manor\r\n\r\n## Tresendar Manor\r\n- We see footprints leading to the cellar, so we follow it there\r\n    - We hear RBRs talking about \"ugly, helpful things\"\r\n    - We see a dungeon through the peephole of the cellar door\r\n- We head out and try to find a secret entrance but fail\r\n- Tim tries to distract them by placing Minor Illusion up the stairs from the cellar\r\n- Nothic comes out to investigate, but failed\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">We fight it and defeat it, then it disappears into the Underdark</span>\r\n- We go into the cellar\r\n- We don't see any people, just sleeping goblins\r\n- We hear rituals happening through the walls\r\n- **We save Mirna and also find Sildar, who just happened to be there too**\r\n    - We tell Sildar to take Mirna back to town\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">We find three cultists that just summoned a Spectator, then fight us</span>\r\n    - **We kill them and each gain 4 GP, except Erik who gains 3 GP**\r\n    - We take the cultist's masks\r\n- *We Short Rest*\r\n- We go back into the main room and pretend to be cultists using the masks we stole, in order to avoid confrontation with the bug bear and goblins\r\n- We eventually find a room with workers, who tells us Glasstaff is in his office next door\r\n    - Since we can't get in the room without the code word, we talk to Glasstaff through the door\r\n    - We convince him to come out by telling him the prisoners escaped\r\n    - He believes us at first, but we go too far and the other workers expose to Glasstaff that we don't know the code word\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Glasstaff deduces we're intruders and fights us with the rest of the workers</span>\r\n    - **We defeat him and interrogate him, revealing...**\r\n        - The mayor isn't in cahoots with them\r\n        - The code word is \"Fear the Black Spider\"\r\n        - He was ordered to make a mess of the place by the Black Spider, who runs everything\r\n        - **He disintegrates before telling us more**\r\n    - **Shadow takes the Glass Staff**\r\n    - **We gain 90 GP and 6 short swords**\r\n- **We go to Glasstaff's office and see his diary**\r\n    - 3 weeks ago:\r\n    > My new name is \"Glasstaff\" \r\n\r\n    > I was tasked to lead the Redbrand Ruffians for Black Spider\r\n    - Few days ago\r\n    > We finally got ahold of the Rockseeker brothers, who are being held in Cragmaw Castle\r\n    \r\n    > We're also looking for the secret cave\r\n- **If you think of the Black Spider's real name, you disintegrate**\r\n    - The guy who disintegrated at Stone Hill Inn knew Black Spider's real name because he was Black Spider's boyfriend -- Black Spider is gay\r\n\r\n## Return to town\r\n- We meet Sildar and Mirna at Stone Hill Inn, and she invites us to her farm for a meal\r\n- At Mirna's farm\r\n    - She makes us rabbit stew and tells us about her family from Thundertree\r\n    - Due to a wizard's mishap (*cough* Iarno *cough*), people from Thundertree turned into zombies\r\n    - Carp's parents were turned into zombies at Thundertree and ate her parents\r\n    - She and Carp escaped the zombies\r\n    - **She offers us her blacksmith family's heirlooms at Thundertree as a reward**\r\n    - Sildar offers Mirna 10 GP, and Akta takes 10 GP from her...\r\n- *We Long Rest* at Stone Hill Inn\r\n- We head to the Sleeping Giant to eliminate the RBRs\r\n    - We tell the grunts that someone left the bag of weapons at Stone Hill Inn\r\n    - A scary drow believes me and leaves the building, heading there\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">**We defeat all the RBRs, 6 total**</span>\r\n- We return to Stone Hill Inn\r\n    - **According to Taryn, the drow just checked for the weapons, didn't find it, then left the city, northbound**\r\n    - *We Long Rest*\r\n- We go to the Townmaster's Hall\r\n    - We show Iarno the head of a RBR and the glass staff\r\n    - **We each get 100 GP for completing his mission** and he offers to buy the glass staff for 1000 GP\r\n        - We try to get him to make a 500 GP down payment while we use it in the meantime\r\n        - He disagrees\r\n    - We disrespect him by placing the head of the RBR on his desk\r\n        - He engulfs it in flames\r\n\r\n## Thundertree\r\n- We all head to Thundertree with Sildar\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Immediately, Ents attack us and get fucked by Emiret</span>\r\n- We meet Reidoth, druid from the Emerald Enclave\r\n    - He watches over Phandalin and warns people who enter this area of the zombies\r\n    - He studied the zombification phenomenon\r\n    - Can fight but prefers not to\r\n- **Reidoth gives us a map of Cragmaw Castle**\r\n    - In exchange, he asks us to convince the cultists here to leave the nearby tower\r\n        - They are dragon-worshippers that keep giving gifts to the dragon that lives in the tower in the east\r\n        - **If we drive the dragon away or kill it, we get to keep the loot**\r\n- He tells us about Phandelver's Pact\r\n    - It's the agreement to share Wave Echo Cave (WEC), which has unlimited minerals to mine between the humans, elves, etc.\r\n    - He knows where it is (and it's the cave Gundren is looking for)\r\n- We decide to look around the area...\r\n    - **We find Dendrar's Silver Crown, Mirna's family's heirloom, worth 5000 GP**\r\n        - **It can be given to a witch nearby for a favor**\r\n- We encounter the cultists\r\n    - We convince them to instead praise Shenron Barney Targeryn V ![Shenron Barney Targeryn V](./assets/images/shenron.png)\r\n- We tell Reidoth that the dragon might terrorize neighboring villages now that the cultists are leaving\r\n    - He becomes worried and decides to talk to Iarno about it\r\n- **He gives us a map of Wave Echo Cave**\r\n- We ask if there's a witch nearby...\r\n    - Agatha is an introverted witch that lives 1 hour south, near Connyberry  Village\r\n- We decide to talk to the dragon, Venomfang\r\n    - Sildar gets frustrated that we've abandoned the main mission (lol) and leaves before we confront Venomfang\r\n    - We convince Venomfang to go to Neverwinter for more riches, but he still wants to eat us...\r\n    - We lure him outside, telling him he can eat Akta's arm instead of eating us\r\n    - Akta feigns cutting off his arm twice, attempting to attack Venomfang, but misses both times\r\n        - <span style=\"color:red\">Venomfang attacks us</span>\r\n        - Mid-combat, Iarno, Reidoth, and Sildar arrive to help\r\n        - We also summon the owl bear to help out\r\n        - **We slay Venomfang!**\r\n- Since we slayed Venomfang, we were told where WEC is\r\n    - *Everyone* now knows where it is, including Iarno\r\n    - Technically, we don't need to save Gundren anymore, we can just go straight to WEC, since our summoner is Korvak\r\n    - We decide to go to Connyberry first\r\n\r\n## Connyberry\r\n- Arrive at 20:00 -- it's foggy\r\n- We see the entrance of her home: a hole in a tree with a lantern outside\r\n    - Emiret throws paper airplane made of Pamphlet of Researchtology through the opening, which flies in but disappears\r\n- The witch comes out with the paper airplane in her hand then burns it\r\n    - She sees the Dendrar's Silver Crown on Akta's head and asks him if he's a descendant of a Dendrar\r\n    - She eventually takes the crown off Akta's head\r\n    - Akta asks for information before letting her keep the crown\r\n    - She says: \"I made a pact so that in exchange for the crown, I'll help the Dendrar family as much as I can\"\r\n- We ask her for 6000 GP\r\n    - She instead offers to tell us about WEC, but we already know about it\r\n        - She then realizes that we're foreigners and tells us we can't use the money in the cave because we'd need to mine it\r\n- We start asking her about the Black Spider, but she refuses to give info without the crown or Mirna\r\n- We contemplate killing her, so we ask how strong she is\r\n    - She says that she's weaker than Venomfang, she thinks she *may be able to* kill Iarno\r\n    - **We ask her why she wouldn't want to kill Iarno, and she says: \"What's the point in killing a puppet?\"**\r\n- We eventually agree to get Mirna and give her to the witch so she can break the pact without us having to give the witch the crown\r\n    - But we have to leave her with Gondorf and the crown\r\n    - Gondorf learns a new spell in the meantime\r\n- We bring her Mirna\r\n    - She demands we ask her our question now... We ask: \"Tell us everything about the Black Spider\"\r\n        - His name is Nezznar\r\n        - He's a drow\r\n        - He leads a band of elves who are seeking to take over WEC\r\n- The witch shrivels up and turns into dust\r\n    - The fog lifts from the forest\r\n    - Essentially, Agatha was a banshee (already dead) and her pact with the Dendrars were keeping her in this world, so breaking the pact with Mirna allowed her to die\r\n    - **We get to keep the 5000 GP crown and Mirna, yay :)**\r\n\r\n## Return to Phandalin\r\n- Korvak wants to save Gundren before going to WEC, but Sildar doesn't care about him anymore\r\n- Tim convinces them to save Gundren by saying Gundren will give them the riches from WEC\r\n- Before heading to Cragmaw Castle, we go to see Iarno\r\n    - Thanks us for helping with the dragon, offers us stuff in exchange for our services\r\n    - **Offers us gold (1500 each), or new spells, or potions**\r\n        - **Hildebrand buys Summon Elemental from me for 100 GP**\r\n- We head to Cragmaw Castle with Sildar\r\n\r\n## Cragmaw Castle\r\n- We see muddy footsteps leading up the stairs and through entryway, with dried blood -- looks like someone was dragged\r\n- A drow spots us and tells us to leave, tells us Gundren isn't here\r\n    - We show the drow the Glass Staff, but he doesn't recognize it\r\n- We decide to just go around the building on the south side\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">We encounter some goblins and kill them</span>\r\n    - *We Long Rest*\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Kill some drows</span> \r\n- **Lockpick next door, found Gundren and Jarvani!**\r\n- We encounter a bugbear and convince him to take us to his King\r\n- We overhear a drow threatening the King with a weapon; the conversation:\r\n    - Goblins had made a deal with the drow to kidnap Gundren\r\n    - Drow is now asking for Gundren, but King Goblin wants more in exchange\r\n    - But drow is refusing to give more, and now wants to just kill King Goblin\r\n- We attempt to lead the bugbear out of the castle, but he insists to bring the King out to us instead\r\n    - Drow offers to deal with us in the King's stead, and King says he'll let the drow \"have the dwarf [Gundren]\" if the drow takes care of the situation\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Drow and bugbear come out to greet us all, see us with Gundren, and decide to attack us</span> \r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">We knock the drow out unconscious and the bugbear surrenders\r\n    - We rip the bugbear's tongue out</span> \r\n    - We find a note on the drow: \r\n        - There's a stamp at the bottom that looks like a spider\r\n        - \"Bring Gundren to this location: *picture of WEC*\"\r\n- **We interrogate the drow, and we learn:**\r\n    - Black Spider is maybe at WEC\r\n    - Drow doesn't know why they need Gundren at WEC\r\n    - He knows the Black Spider seeks \"something\" at WEC\r\n    - He conjures up an image of what the Black Spider looks like, and tells us he uses drow weapons and to be wary of the \"spider staff\", which is poisonous\r\n    - The Black Spider's weakness is that \"he has no mercy for his victims\"\r\n    - Apparently, Iarno and Black Spider have a deal -- Iarno leaves alone the RBRs, and in return Iarno gets sole ownership of WEC\r\n        - RBR's purpose is to get the supplies to excavate WEC\r\n        - Iarno broke the agreement by hiring us\r\n        - He doesn't know why BS is offering Iarno WEC\r\n        - Sildar is confused about things\r\n    - BS is stronger than Iarno\r\n    - BS is a warrior class\r\n    - Not sure if BS is alone in WEC\r\n    - Drow is BS's right-hand man\r\n    - RBRs need to stay in Phandalin\r\n- **We kill the drow** and hang him from a tree\r\n- **The King Goblin agrees to help us at WEC**\r\n\r\n## Back to Phandalin to confront Iarno\r\n- We claims to not know the drow, BS, and the plans with the WEC\r\n- He admits that he hired people to be the RBRs, mess up Phandalin, then beat the RBRs to get the respect of the people, so they elect him Townmaster\r\n    - Afterwards, he tried to get rid of the RBRs, but they stopped listening to him\r\n    - Then he hired us to get rid of then\r\n- We threaten to expose him to the townspeople\r\n    - He claims to have leverage, because they won't believe us, and if he kill him then they'll turn on us\r\n- Glasstaff was Iarno's disciple\r\n- \"Were you working with the goblins when you were colluding with the RBRs?\"\r\n    - \"No, and I didn't ask them to kidnap Gundren, and I didn't know about WEC until you told me\"\r\n- He's offering us 15,000 GP to leave him alone\r\n    - He makes Gondorf drink a truth potion and promise to leave him alone after receiving the GP\r\n        - Iarno promises to leave us alone after giving us the GP\r\n- Hildebrand attempts to use Magic Missile on him, but it goes right through him\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">He says \"What a pity\" and the GP we received also disappears, now starting the fight</span>\r\n    - We incapacitate him and tie him up\r\n    - **We dig through his pockets and find 1000 GP and a scroll to teleport to Neverwinter**\r\n- \"Why do you have a scroll to Neverwinter?\"\r\n    - He wanted to run away to Neverwinter if we didn't leave him alone\r\n    - He revealed: if we promised to leave him alone, take the GP, then left, he would've made the GP disappear then teleport to Neverwinter anyway\r\n- **He refuses to give us any more info, so Emiret kills him but pouring a pint of acid dragon blood into his mouth**\r\n\r\n## Post-Iarno fight\r\n- *We Long Rest at Stonehill Inn*\r\n- We hear the patrons + Taryn discussing that there's been a combat in his office and that he has disappeared\r\n    - We assure Taryn he's strong and will probably come back\r\n- We let Sildar know that we're going to WEC, and decide not to take him with us\r\n- We head to Minghee's shop\r\n    - **Akta buys Miner's Pick and Crossbow Bolts**\r\n    - **We sell stuff**\r\n    - Minghee tells us she supports Iarno, but finds that he became townmaster inorganically\r\n- We head to WEC\r\n\r\n## Wave Echo Cave\r\n- We see Nezznar having a conversation with a drow and a dwarf (Nundro Rockseeker)\r\n    - Nezznar asking where Gundren is, because he needs him to navigate the cave\r\n    - Drow reveals that Vyerith is dead\r\n    - RBRs were supposed to summon creatures, according to Nezznar\r\n    - Drow reveals all RBRs are dead\r\n    - Nezznar intends to visit the town\r\n    - Nezznar intends to kill Nundro, preparing a spell to do so, and Nundro pleads for his life\r\n    - Emiret uses Mage Hand to attempt to throw a rock to distract Nezznar\r\n    - Nezznar notices the rock and starts looking for us\r\n- Nezznar encounters Hildebrand, who failed to hide\r\n- Emiret talks to Nundro, who turns out to be Gundren's brother\r\n    - Nundro, Tharden (another dwarf), and Gundren were supposed to go through WEC together\r\n    - Gundren was late, and Nundro and Tharden were captured by Nezznar and tortured; Tharden died \r\n- We agree to help Nezznar navigate the cave\r\n    - **He tells us we're looking for the Forge of Spells, which can enhance weapons**\r\n    -  It's supposedly in the cave but he doesn't know what it looks like\r\n- We reveal to Nezznar that Iarno isn't in Phandalin\r\n    - Nezznar gets excited because Iarno is the reason that he hasn't taken over Phandalin\r\n    - He wants to immediately return to Phandalin and terrorize the villagers\r\n        - Doesn't need the Forge of Spells anymore, because he only needed that to defeat Iarno\r\n    - While trying to keep him from leaving, he gets angry at us and wants to kill us\r\n- Tim tries to convince him to take over a different town, Shenronville\r\n    - He agrees but is still insistent on taking over Phandalin \r\n    - He at least decides to not kill us because we'll \"help him take over Shenronville\"\r\n- Akta tries to show him a \"trick\" with his Lightbringer...\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Akta swings at him, initiating a fight</span>\r\n    - We kill the drow, but **Nezznar escapes with Misty Step and Invisibility**\r\n- We send Nundro with a handaxe back to Phandalin to warn them that Nezznar wants to kill them\r\n    - Sweating, he hesistantly agrees and stumbles off\r\n- *We Short Rest by the fire at the entrance of the cave* then head out to explore the cave, splitting up\r\n- Group 1: Akta, Gondorf, Hildebrand\r\n    - Akta discovers something dripping and sticks an arrow under it; the arrow gets dissolved\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">They run into an Ochre Jelly, initiating a fight; they defeat it</span>\r\n    -

In the room next to us, we see unlit torches, carvings of dwarves working in the walls, and dead skeletons all around, one of them being a dwarf\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Emiret uses Mage Hand to move a skull in a room next to us, which prompts Stirges to fall down from the ceiling, initiating a fight; we eventually defeat them (or most of them?)</span>\r\n- Group 2 meets up with Group 1, and then <span style=\"color:red\">a giant constrictor snake comes out of the water; we defeat it</span>\r\n    - After we defeat it, we see something shiny in the water\r\n    - We manage to drag it out with Mage Hand -- it's a wizard skeleton with **3 gold rings worth 150 GP and a Wand of Magic Missile**\r\n- We go into the room at the top of the stairs and find an Ogre Zombie that has its guts spilling out of it\r\n    - Gondorf Fire Bolts it and wakes it up\r\n    - We leave lol\r\n- We arrive at a large room with a waterfall\r\n    - No footprints here though, instead we find footprints going back towards the stairs and water room\r\n    - We follow the footprints back to the water room, then walk down a path of shallow water and circle back to the waterfall room\r\n    - We see footprints up some stairs in the room and follow it, seeing broken cobwebs throughout the hallway\r\n- We see a big room with rubble\r\n    - Tim sees a corpse buried in the rubble\r\n    - Akta sees a 9-foot tall statue of a dwarf on a throne, also now mostly rubble\r\n    - Meanwhile, Emiret opens a door to a room nearby and sees Nezznar sleeping soundly on a makeshift bed\r\n- We all sneak into the room and close the door\r\n    - Tim casts Faerie Fire on Nezznar to prevent him from going invisible\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Hildebrand shoots at him with the Poisonous Pistol, waking him up and initiating the fight</span>\r\n        - We quickly incapacitate him, then tie him up and **take his shoes, staff, and 280 GP**\r\n        - We light up a fire in the middle of the room and hold him up over the fire\r\n- We start interrogating him...\r\n    - He works for the drows and they're looking for \"a home in the light\" :(((\r\n    - We wanna feed him to the troll and he begs to just be allowed to return to his people\r\n    - Turns out he didn't make any deal with Iarno\r\n    - His family is \"the drow he leads\"\r\n    - He was just using the RBRs to mess up the town to make it easier to take over\r\n    - He wanted to make an example of a few citizens in Phandalin to drive them out so the drow could move in\r\n    - He just wanted to get the Rockseeker brothers to help him find the Forge\r\n    - We're gaslighting him into thinking he killed Iarno ???\r\n- We start dragging him to the Ogre Zombie\r\n    - He Misty Steps away from us\r\n    - We put a bag on his head\r\n- We notice a hallway in the direction he Misty Stepped in -- we instead go that way (with Nezznar), which leads to the Forge\r\n    - There's a water wheel with a 10-foot deep channel that has no water in it\r\n    - Corpses scattered around the room\r\n    - A floating green skull flies towards us and tells us to leave because his summoner said we can't pass\r\n        - Tells us this is the Smelter's Cavern and implies the forge is here\r\n        - We try to offer Nezznar but apparently his master doesn't need any more corpses; he shows us the zombies and threatens us with them\r\n        - We start to leave and he says wants us to leave Nezznar, but we insist he can only have him if we can pass; he agrees and lets us leave with Nezznar\r\n        - We then realize we can manipulate the skull -- Gondorf lies about having an appointment with his master in order to enter\r\n    - We meet up with the master, who's a wraith named Mormesk\r\n        - We offer Nezznar, saying Nezznar intended to destroy the Forge and we killed him to prevent him from doing so\r\n        - The wraith drains the life from Nezznar and turns him into a specter\r\n        - He asks if we're a part of the Phandelver's Pact, and we say who don't know what it is, so he goes into a rant... \r\n            - He used to be a human mage who ran WEC\r\n            - The Orcs came and attacked, destroying the WEC and Phandalin\r\n            - His spirit remains here, waiting for the successor of the cave -- his last name is Rockseeker\r\n        - Emiret emphasizes that Nezznar was going to destroy the Rockseekers, and we killed him to prevent that\r\n        - **He offers us an enchanted flame to feed to Gundren (it will survive for 12 hours) and then we give Gundren to him**\r\n- Nezznar-Ghost leads us out, also leading us through a large room of skeletons with tables\r\n\r\n## Arriving back at Stonehill Inn\r\n- Emiret stuffs the flame into (an unconscious) Gundren's mouth; he bursts into flames but it looks like it's improving his body\r\n    - He wakes up, angry and confused, asking where \"she\" is\r\n    - Emiret tells him we found his ancestor in WEC\r\n    -   He's confused about who we are, how we found WEC, and his ancestor\r\n- Gundren runs downstairs and is greeted by Nundro, Sildar, and us\r\n    - We tell him about Nezznar\r\n    - Nundro fills him in about everything that happened (except Tharden's death) and Gundren yells at him\r\n- Gundren reveals that Elena got them kidnapped; we all head to Barthen's Provisions\r\n    - Apparently she paid the goblins to kidnap him and she also tortured him for information\r\n    - She wasn't there, so we just headed back to the Stonehill Inn\r\n- Gundren tells us what he wants to do with WEC...\r\n    - He found a map of the cave, and where it was, in his hosue\r\n    - He needed our help clearing the cave and building it back up\r\n    - We try asking him about Iarno... Of course, he doesn't know where he is\r\n- *We Long Rest at the Stonehill Inn*\r\n\r\n## Heading back to Wave Echo Cave\r\n- We first bury Tharden\r\n    - Gundren offers one of Tharden's items to Gondorf: a large cloth (he won't tell us what it is)\r\n- We start to explore the cave\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Emiret runs into some ghouls... They attack her</span>\r\n    - Tim joins this combat\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">The others run into an Ochre Jelly and get attacked</span>\r\n- We defeat them in both combats\r\n- We continue to explore the many rooms of WEC...\r\n    - Found a pickaxe\r\n    - Found a place we can rest\r\n    - Found a skeleton of a large ogre\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Akta and Jarvani fight two ghouls that were munching on stuff</span>\r\n- We continue to explore...\r\n    - We see the door to Mormesk is blocked by a large zombie\r\n        - Gundren shouts \"MORMESK!\" but the zombie continues to sleep\r\n        - Mormesk eventually goes up to the zombie and shoves it away, so it moves\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Nearby, an octopus pops out of a body of water and grabs Hildebrand, and we eventually kill it</span>\r\n- We give Gundren to Mormesk\r\n    - Gundren is set on fire, Nundren tries to save him but is also set on fire\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Mormesk also sets Emiret on fire</span>\r\n        - For some reason, in the meantime, Akta tries to use his pickaxe to dig out the minerals from the wall, but he instead shatters it\r\n        - We eventually defeat Mormesk, the floating green skull, and Nezznar-Ghost\r\n        - After defeating him, we notice the brazier is afire; this is the Forge of Spells that can currently only enchant one weapon\r\n            - We dip Akta's Greataxe in there to enchant it\r\n- We continue to explore\r\n    - We find a room and open a chest, finding 277/6 people GP in total\r\n- We continue to try mining\r\n    - Tim mines off pieces of emerald, worth...\r\n        - 25 GP, and \r\n        - 300 GP, and\r\n        - 25 GP, and\r\n        - 75 GP\r\n    - The others mine stuff, too\r\n- Akta climbs over the emerald to discover the room it's blocking\r\n    - The fungi inside start to produce smoke filling up the room\r\n    - Hildebrand, Emerit, Gondorf go there too\r\n- Akta retrieves a glaive in the boss's room and a diamond in another room\r\n- We decide to leave the cave\r\n\r\n## Back to Sildar and Korvak in Phandalin\r\n- We tell them that we dropped Gundren and Nundro off at the ancestor, who we described as a human wizard (and this made him suspicious, because Gundren is a dwarf...)\r\n- Apparently, Elena and her daughter have disappeared\r\n    - We also try gaslighting them into thinking that Elena tried to have someone pose as the ancestor to lure Gundren and Nundro there to kill them, since she's supposed to be the next successor of the cave\r\n- Apparently, Mormesk is supposed to be the one to oversee the cave\r\n- Sildar is the new mayor of the town, but he's unsure of his skills\r\n- Overall, Korvak believes Gundren and Nundro are still in the cave so he'll go look for them\r\n- ** KORVAC CRUSHES THE SUMMONING STONE, ALLOWING US TO GO HOME **\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:red\"></span>","n":0.014}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tutorial","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\r\nWelcome to Dendron!
