<li><strong>Apparently, Gundren is the successor of a legendary cave that has infinite treasure</strong></li>
<li><strong>But no one knows where the cave is, except Gundren claims to have a map to it</strong></li>
<li>Gundren may have been abducted for this knowledge</li>

<li>She also recommends we talk to Iarno, the townmaster who helped established the town</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We go to Stone Hill Inn

<li>Sildar and Korvak pay for our rooms</li>
<li>A patron at the inn says that Iarno is nice and the Redbrand Ruffians (RBRs) have been terrorizing the townspeople</li>

<li><strong>He doesn't know where Cragmaw Castle is, but refers us to a druid at the Ruins of Thunder Tree</strong></li>

<li>His boss, Glasstaff, is stronger than him</li>
<li>His friends explode into dust because they're "not trusted enough", but he is</li>
<li>Iarno isn't helping them</li>
<li>He has over a dozen men in his command</li>
<li>The objective of the RBRs is to take over Phandalin, for wealth that was promised to them</li>
<li>They stash their gold in the Sleeping Giant</li>
<li>He doesn't know who Gundren is</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>He tells us about Phandelver's Pact
<ul>
<li>It's the agreement to share Wave Echo Cave (WEC), which has unlimited minerals to mine between the humans, elves, etc.</li>
<li>He knows where it is (and it's the cave Gundren is looking for)</li>

<li>We tell Reidoth that the dragon might terrorize neighboring villages now that the cultists are leaving
<ul>
<li>He becomes worried and decides to talk to Iarno about it</li>

<li><strong>He gives us a map of Wave Echo Cave</strong></li>
<li>We ask if there's a witch nearby...
<ul>
<li>Agatha is an introverted witch that lives 1 hour south, near Connyberry  Village</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We decide to talk to the dragon, Venomfang
<ul>
<li>Sildar gets frustrated that we've abandoned the main mission (lol) and leaves before we confront Venomfang</li>
<li>We convince Venomfang to go to Neverwinter for more riches, but he still wants to eat us...</li>
<li>We lure him outside, telling him he can eat Akta's arm instead of eating us</li>
<li>Akta feigns cutting off his arm twice, attempting to attack Venomfang, but misses both times
<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">Venomfang attacks us</span></li>
<li>Mid-combat, Iarno, Reidoth, and Sildar arrive to help</li>

<li>She eventually takes the crown off Akta's head</li>
<li>Akta asks for information before letting her keep the crown</li>
<li>She says: "I made a pact so that in exchange for the crown, I'll help the Dendrar family as much as I can"</li>

</li>
<li>We ask her for 6000 GP

<li>She instead offers to tell us about WEC, but we already know about it

</ul>
</li>
<li>We start asking her about the Black Spider, but she refuses to give info without the crown or Mirna</li>

<li>We eventually agree to get Mirna and give her to the witch so she can break the pact without us having to give the witch the crown
<ul>
<li>But we have to leave her with Gondorf and the crown</li>
<li>Gondorf learns a new spell in the meantime</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We bring her Mirna
<ul>
<li>She demands we ask her our question now... We ask: "Tell us everything about the Black Spider"
<ul>
<li>His name is Nezznar</li>
<li>He's a drow</li>
<li>He leads a band of elves who are seeking to take over WEC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The witch shrivels up and turns into dust
<ul>
<li>The fog lifts from the forest</li>
<li>Essentially, Agatha was a banshee (already dead) and her pact with the Dendrars were keeping her in this world, so breaking the pact with Mirna allowed her to die</li>
<li><strong>We get to keep the 5000 GP crown and Mirna, yay :)</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>We see muddy footsteps leading up the stairs and through entryway, with dried blood -- looks like someone was dragged</li>
<li>A drow spots us and tells us to leave, tells us Gundren isn't here
<ul>
<li>We show the drow the Glass Staff, but he doesn't recognize it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We decide to just go around the building on the south side

<li><strong>Lockpick next door, found Gundren and Jarvani!</strong></li>
<li>We encounter a bugbear and convince him to take us to his King</li>
<li>We overhear a drow threatening the King with a weapon; the conversation:
<ul>
<li>Goblins had made a deal with the drow to kidnap Gundren</li>
<li>Drow is now asking for Gundren, but King Goblin wants more in exchange</li>
<li>But drow is refusing to give more, and now wants to just kill King Goblin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We attempt to lead the bugbear out of the castle, but he insists to bring the King out to us instead
<ul>
<li>Drow offers to deal with us in the King's stead, and King says he'll let the drow "have the dwarf [Gundren]" if the drow takes care of the situation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color:red">Drow and bugbear come out to greet us all, see us with Gundren, and decide to attack us</span> 
<ul>

<li>"Bring Gundren to this location: <em>picture of WEC</em>"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>We interrogate the drow, and we learn:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Black Spider is maybe at WEC</li>
<li>Drow doesn't know why they need Gundren at WEC</li>
<li>He knows the Black Spider seeks "something" at WEC</li>
<li>He conjures up an image of what the Black Spider looks like, and tells us he uses drow weapons and to be wary of the "spider staff", which is poisonous</li>
<li>The Black Spider's weakness is that "he has no mercy for his victims"</li>
<li>Apparently, Iarno and Black Spider have a deal -- Iarno leaves alone the RBRs, and in return Iarno gets sole ownership of WEC
<ul>
<li>RBR's purpose is to get the supplies to excavate WEC</li>
<li>Iarno broke the agreement by hiring us</li>
<li>He doesn't know why BS is offering Iarno WEC</li>
<li>Sildar is confused about things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BS is stronger than Iarno</li>
<li>BS is a warrior class</li>
<li>Not sure if BS is alone in WEC</li>
<li>Drow is BS's right-hand man</li>
<li>RBRs need to stay in Phandalin</li>

<ul>
<li>We claims to not know the drow, BS, and the plans with the WEC</li>
<li>He admits that he hired people to be the RBRs, mess up Phandalin, then beat the RBRs to get the respect of the people, so they elect him Townmaster
<ul>
<li>Afterwards, he tried to get rid of the RBRs, but they stopped listening to him</li>
<li>Then he hired us to get rid of then</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We threaten to expose him to the townspeople
<ul>
<li>He claims to have leverage, because they won't believe us, and if he kill him then they'll turn on us</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Glasstaff was Iarno's disciple</li>
<li>"Were you working with the goblins when you were colluding with the RBRs?"
<ul>
<li>"No, and I didn't ask them to kidnap Gundren, and I didn't know about WEC until you told me"</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>"Why do you have a scroll to Neverwinter?"

<li>Nezznar asking where Gundren is, because he needs him to navigate the cave</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>He wants to immediately return to Phandalin and terrorize the villagers
<ul>
<li>Doesn't need the Forge of Spells anymore, because he only needed that to defeat Iarno</li>

<li>Sweating, he hesistantly agrees and stumbles off</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>We Short Rest by the fire at the entrance of the cave</em> then head out to explore the cave, splitting up</li>
<li>Group 1: Akta, Gondorf, Hildebrand
<ul>
<li>Akta discovers something dripping and sticks an arrow under it; the arrow gets dissolved</li>
<li><span style="color:red">They run into an Ochre Jelly, initiating a fight; they defeat it</span></li>
<li>In another room, they see a still pool surrounded by broken shells of mussels
<ul>
<li>They notice footprints leading towards stairs and towards a door</li>
<li>There's something in the water... </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group 2: Tim and Emiret
<ul>
<li>In the room next to us, we see unlit torches, carvings of dwarves working in the walls, and dead skeletons all around, one of them being a dwarf</li>
<li><span style="color:red">Emiret uses Mage Hand to move a skull in a room next to us, which prompts Stirges to fall down from the ceiling, initiating a fight; we eventually defeat them (or most of them?)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group 2 meets up with Group 1, and then <span style="color:red">a giant constrictor snake comes out of the water; we defeat it</span>
<ul>
<li>After we defeat it, we see something shiny in the water</li>
<li>We manage to drag it out with Mage Hand -- it's a wizard skeleton with <strong>3 gold rings worth 150 GP and a Wand of Magic Missile</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We go into the room at the top of the stairs and find an Ogre Zombie that has its guts spilling out of it
<ul>
<li>Gondorf Fire Bolts it and wakes it up</li>
<li>We leave lol</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We arrive at a large room with a waterfall
<ul>
<li>No footprints here though, instead we find footprints going back towards the stairs and water room</li>
<li>We follow the footprints back to the water room, then walk down a path of shallow water and circle back to the waterfall room</li>
<li>We see footprints up some stairs in the room and follow it, seeing broken cobwebs throughout the hallway</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We see a big room with rubble
<ul>
<li>Tim sees a corpse buried in the rubble</li>
<li>Akta sees a 9-foot tall statue of a dwarf on a throne, also now mostly rubble</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Emiret opens a door to a room nearby and sees Nezznar sleeping soundly on a makeshift bed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We all sneak into the room and close the door
<ul>
<li>Tim casts Faerie Fire on Nezznar to prevent him from going invisible</li>
<li><span style="color:red">Hildebrand shoots at him with the Poisonous Pistol, waking him up and initiating the fight</span>

<li>We quickly incapacitate him, then tie him up and <strong>take his shoes, staff, and 280 GP</strong></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We start interrogating him...
<ul>
<li>He works for the drows and they're looking for "a home in the light" :(((</li>
<li>We wanna feed him to the troll and he begs to just be allowed to return to his people</li>
<li>Turns out he didn't make any deal with Iarno</li>
<li>His family is "the drow he leads"</li>
<li>He was just using the RBRs to mess up the town to make it easier to take over</li>
<li>He wanted to make an example of a few citizens in Phandalin to drive them out so the drow could move in</li>
<li>He just wanted to get the Rockseeker brothers to help him find the Forge</li>
<li>We're gaslighting him into thinking he killed Iarno ???</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We start dragging him to the Ogre Zombie
<ul>
<li>He Misty Steps away from us</li>
<li>We put a bag on his head</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We notice a hallway in the direction he Misty Stepped in -- we instead go that way (with Nezznar), which leads to the Forge
<ul>
<li>There's a water wheel with a 10-foot deep channel that has no water in it</li>
<li>Corpses scattered around the room</li>
<li>A floating green skull flies towards us and tells us to leave because his summoner said we can't pass
<ul>
<li>Tells us this is the Smelter's Cavern and implies the forge is here</li>
<li>We try to offer Nezznar but apparently his master doesn't need any more corpses; he shows us the zombies and threatens us with them</li>
<li>We start to leave and he says wants us to leave Nezznar, but we insist he can only have him if we can pass; he agrees and lets us leave with Nezznar</li>
<li>We then realize we can manipulate the skull -- Gondorf lies about having an appointment with his master in order to enter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We meet up with the master, who's a wraith named Mormesk
<ul>
<li>We offer Nezznar, saying Nezznar intended to destroy the Forge and we killed him to prevent him from doing so</li>
<li>The wraith drains the life from Nezznar and turns him into a specter</li>
<li>He asks if we're a part of the Phandelver's Pact, and we say who don't know what it is, so he goes into a rant... 
<ul>
<li>He used to be a human mage who ran WEC</li>
<li>The Orcs came and attacked, destroying the WEC and Phandalin</li>
<li>His spirit remains here, waiting for the successor of the cave -- his last name is Rockseeker</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emiret emphasizes that Nezznar was going to destroy the Rockseekers, and we killed him to prevent that</li>
<li><strong>He offers us an enchanted flame to feed to Gundren (it will survive for 12 hours) and then we give Gundren to him</strong></li>

<li>He wakes up, angry and confused, asking where "she" is</li>
<li>Emiret tells him we found his ancestor in WEC</li>
<li>He's confused about who we are, how we found WEC, and his ancestor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gundren runs downstairs and is greeted by Nundro, Sildar, and us
