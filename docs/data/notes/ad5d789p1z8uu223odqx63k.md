## Thundertree
- <span style="color:red">Immediately, Ends attack us and get fucked by Emerit</span>
- We meet Reidoth, druid from the Emerald Enclave
    - He watches over Phandalen and warns people who enter this area of the zombies
    - He studied the zombification phenomenon
    - Can fight but prefers not to
- **Reidoth gives us a map of Cragmaw Castle**
    - In exchange, he asks us to convince the cultists here to leave the nearby tower
        - They are dragon-worshippers that keep giving gifts to the dragon that lives in the tower in the east
        - They wear black masks and cloaks
        - If we drive the dragon away or kill it, we get to keep the loot
- Phandelver's Pact
    - It's the agreement to share Wave Echo cave, which has unlimited minerals to mine between the humans, elves, etc.
    - He knows where it is (and it's the cave Gundren is looking for)
- We decide to look around the area...
    - **We find Dendrar's Silver Crown, Mirna's family's heirloom, worth 5000 GP**
        - **It can be given to a witch nearby for a favor**
- We encounter the cultists
    - We convince them to instead praise Shenron Barney Targeryn V ![Shenron Barney Targeryn V](./assets/images/shenron.png)
- We tell Reidoth that the dragon might terrorize neighboring villages now that the cultists are leaving
    - He becomes worries and decides to talk to Iarno about it
- **He gives us a map of Wave Echo cave**
- We ask if there's a witch nearby...
    - Agatha is a with that lives 1 hour south, near Connyberry  Village
    - Agatha is introverted
- We decide to talk to the dragon, Venomfang
    - Sildar gets frustrated that we've abandoned the main mission (lol) and leaves before we confront Venomfang
    - We convince Venomfang to try to go to Neverwinter for more riches, but he still wants to eat us...
    - We lure him outside, telling him he can eat Akta's arm instead of eating us
    - <span style="color:red">Akta feigns cutting off his arm twice, attempting to attack Venomfang, but misses both times</span>
        - Venomfang attacks us
        - Mid-combat, Iarno, Reidoth, and Sildar arrive to help
        - We slay Venomfang!
- Since we slayed Venomfang, we were told where Wave Echo cave is
    - *Everyone* now knows where Wave Echo cave is, including Iarno
    - Technically, we don't need to save Gundren anymore, we can just go straight to Wave Echo cave, since our summoner is Korvac
    - We decide to go to Connyberry first

## Connyberry
- Arrive at 20:00 -- it's foggy
- We see the entrance of her home: a hole in a tree with a lantern outside
    - Emerit aggressively rolls a Rock of Yondallah into the opening
    - Akta whispers "Agatha" towards the opening, and the fog grows colder around us, but no one comes out
    - Emerit throws paper airplane made of Pamphlet of Researchtology through the opening, which flies in but disappears
- The witch comes out with the paper airplane in her hand then burns it
    - She sees the Dendrar's Silver Crown on Akta's head and asks him if he's a descendant of a Dendrar
    - She eventually takes the crown off Akta's head
    - Akta asks for information before letting her keep the crown
    - She says: "I made a pact so that in exchange for the crown, I'll help the Dendrar family as much as I can"
- We ask her for 6000 GP
    - She instead offers to tell us about Wave Echo cave, but we already know about it
        - She then realizes that we're foreigners and tells us we can't use the money in the cave because we'd need to mine it
- We start asking her about the Black Spider, but she refuses to give info without the crown or Mirna
- We contemplate killing her, so we ask how strong she is
    - She says that she's weaker than Venomfang, she thinks she *may be able to* kill Iarno
    - **We ask her why she wouldn't want to kill Iarno, and she says: "What's the point in killing a puppet?"**
- We eventually agree to get Mirna and give it to her so she can break the pact without us having to give her the crown
    - But we have to leave her with Gondorf and the crown
    - Gondorf learns a new spell in the meantime
- We bring her Mirna
    - She demands we ask her our question now... We ask: "Tell us everything about the Black Spider?"
        - His name is Neznar
        - He's a drow
        - He leads a band of elves who are seeking to take over Wave Echo cave
- The witch shrivels up and turns into dust
    - The fog lifts from the forest
    - *Essentially, Agatha was a banshee (already dead) and her pact with the Dendrars were keeping her in this world, so breaking the pact with Mirna allowed her to die*
    - *We get to keep the 5000 GP crown and Mirna, yay :)*

## Return to Phandalen
- Korvac wants to save Gundren, but Sildar doesn't care about him anymore
- We ask: "Korvac, how would you feel if we go straight to Wave Echo cave?"
- Tim convinces them to save Gundren by saying Gundren will give them the riches from Wave Echo cave
- Before heading to Cragmaw Castle, we go to see Iarno
    - Thanks us for helping with the dragon, offers us stuff in exchange for our services
    - Offers us gold (1500 each), or new spells, or potions
        - *Hildebrand buys Summon Elemental from me for 100 GP*
- We head to Cragmaw Castle with Sildar

## Cragmaw Castle
- We see muddy footsteps leading up the stairs and through entryway, with dried blood -- looks like someone was dragged
- A drow spots us and tells us to leave, tells us Gundren isn't here
    - We show the drow the Glass Staff, but he doesn't recognize it
- We decide to just go around the building on the south side
    - <span style="color:red">We encounter some goblins and kill them</span>
    - *We Long Rest*
    - <span style="color:red">Kill some drows</span> 
- **Lockpick next door, found Gundren and Jarvani!**
- We encounter a bugbear, but we convince him to take us to his King
- We overhear a drow threatening the king with a weapon, the conversation:
    - Goblins had made a deal with the drow to kidnap Gundren
    - Drow now asking for Gundren, but King Goblin wants more in exchange
    - But drow is refusing, now wanna kill King Goblin
- We attempt to lead the bugbear out of the castle, but he insists to bring the King out to us instead
    - Drow offers to deal with us in the King's stead, and King says he'll let the drow "have the dwarf [Gundren]" if the drow takes care of the situation
- <span style="color:red">Drow and bugbear come out to greet us all, see us with Gundren, and decide to attack us</span> 
    - <span style="color:red">We knock the drow out unconscious and the bugbear surrenders
    - We rip the bugbear's tongue out</span> 
    - We find a note on the drow: 
        - There's a stamp at the bottom that looks like a spider
        - "Bring Gundren to this location: *picture of Wave Echo cave*"
- We interrogate the drow, and we learn:
    - Black Spider is maybe at Wave Echo cave
    - Drow doesn't know why they need Gundren at Wave Echo cave
    - He knows the Black Spider seeks "something" at Wave Echo cave
    - He conjures up an image of what the Black Spider looks like, and tells us he uses drow weapons and to be wary of the "spider staff", which is poisonous
    - The Black Spider's weakness is that "he has no mercy for his victims"
    - Apparently, Iarno and Black Spider have a deal with Iarno leaves alone the Red Brand Ruffians, and in return Iarno gets sole ownership of WEC
        - RBR's purpose is to get the supplies to excavate WEC
        - Iarno broke the agreement by hiring us
        - He doesn't know why BS is offering Iarno WEC
        - Sildar is confused about things
    - BS is stronger than Iarno
    - BS is a warrior class
    - Not sure if BS is alone in WEC
    - Drow is BS's right-hand man
    - RBRs need to stay in Phandalen
