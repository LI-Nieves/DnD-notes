<ul>
<li>Since we slayed the dragon, we were told where Wave Echo cave is
<ul>
<li><em>Everyone</em> now knows where Wave Echo cave is, including Iarno</li>
<li>Technically, we don't need to save Gundren anymore, we can just go straight to Wave Echo cave, since our summoner is Korvac</li>
<li>We decide to go to Connyberry first</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Arrive at 20:00 -- it's foggy</li>
<li>We see the entrance of her home: a hole in a tree with a lantern outside
<ul>
<li>Emerit aggressively rolls a Rock of Yondallah into the opening</li>
<li>Akta whispers "Agatha" towards the opening
<ul>
<li>Fog grows colder around us, but no one comes out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emerit throws paper airplane made of Pamphlet of Researchtology through the opening
<ul>
<li>The paper airplane flies in but disappears</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The witch comes out with the paper airplane in her hand then burns it
<ul>
<li>She says: "Who are you?!"</li>
<li>Tim greets her politely</li>
<li>She ignores Tim and instead floats towards Akta: "Are you a descendant of a Dendrar?"</li>
<li>We remember Mirna's last name is Dendrar... Akta says: "We found it in a house."</li>
<li>She takes the crown off Akta's head</li>
<li>Akta asks for information before letting her keep the crown</li>
<li>She says: "I made a pact so that in exchange for the crown, I'll help the Dendrar family as much as I can"</li>
<li>We ask her for 6000 GP</li>
<li>She says: "Instead, how about I give you information on how you can get that much gold?"</li>
<li>Tim says: "Are you talking about Wave Echo cave?"</li>
<li>She realizes that we're foreigners and tells us we can't use the money in the cave because we'd need to mine it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We start asking her about the Black Spider...</li>
<li>To gain info without giving up the crown, we would need to give her Mirna</li>
<li>(Curious about how strong she is) She says that she's weaker than Venomfang, she thinks she <em>may be able to</em> kill Iarno</li>
<li>Gondorf gives her a truth serum to drink... She says "Are you sure you wanna waste this on me?", so he puts it back in his bag</li>
<li>We agree to get Mirna and give it to her so she can break the pact without us having to give her the crown
<ul>
<li>But we have to leave her with Gondorf and the crown</li>
<li>Gondorf learns a new spell in the meantime</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We ask her why she wouldn't want to kill Iarno?
<ul>
<li><strong>She says: "What's the point in killing a puppet?"</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We bring her Mirna
<ul>
<li>She demands we ask her our question now... We ask: "Tell us everything about the Black Spider?"
<ul>
<li>Neznar</li>
<li>He's a drow</li>
<li>He leads a band of elves who are seeking to take over Wave Echo cave</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The witch shrivels up and turns into dust</li>
<li>The fog lifts from the forest</li>
<li><em>Essentially, Agatha was a banshee (already dead) and her pact with the Dendrars were keeping her in this world, so breaking the pact with Mirna allowed her to die</em></li>
<li><em>We get to keep the 5000 GP crown and Mirna, yay :)</em></li>

<li>Korvac wants to save Gundren, but Sildar doesn't care about him anymore</li>
<li>We ask: "Korvac, how would you feel if we go straight to Wave Echo cave?"
<ul>
<li>Korvac: "I owe him my life!"</li>
<li>Sildar: "You can live your own life now!"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tim convinces them to save Gundren by saying Gundren will give them the riches from Wave Echo cave</li>
<li>We go to see Iarno
<ul>
<li>Thanks us for helping with the dragon, offers us stuff in exchange for our services</li>
<li>Offers us gold (1500 each), or new spells, or potions
<ul>
<li><em>Hildebrand buys Summon Elemental from me for 100 GP</em></li>

</li>
<li>We head to Cragmaw Castle with Sildar</li>

<ul>
<li>We see muddy footsteps leading up the stairs and through entryway, with dried blood -- looks like someone was dragged</li>
<li>A drow spots us and tells us to leave, tells us Gundren isn't here
<ul>
<li>We show the drow the Glass Staff, but he doesn't recognize it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We decide to just go around the building on the south side</li>
<li><span style="color:red">We encounter some goblins and fight them</span></li>
