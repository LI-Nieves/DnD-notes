<li><span style="color:red">Immediately, Ends attack us and get fucked by Emerit</span></li>
<li>We meet Reidoth, druid from the Emerald Enclave
<ul>
<li>He watches over Phandalen and warns people who enter this area of the zombies</li>
<li>He studied the zombification phenomenon</li>
<li>Can fight but prefers not to</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reidoth gives us a map of Cragmaw Castle</strong>
<ul>
<li>In exchange, he asks us to convince the cultists here to leave the nearby tower
<ul>
<li>They are dragon-worshippers that keep giving gifts to the dragon that lives in the tower in the east</li>
<li>They wear black masks and cloaks</li>
<li>If we drive the dragon away or kill it, we get to keep the loot</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phandelver's Pact
<ul>
<li>It's the agreement to share Wave Echo cave, which has unlimited minerals to mine between the humans, elves, etc.</li>
<li>He knows where it is (and it's the cave Gundren is looking for)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We decide to look around the area...
<ul>
<li><strong>We find Dendrar's Silver Crown, Mirna's family's heirloom, worth 5000 GP</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>It can be given to a witch nearby for a favor</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We encounter the cultists
<ul>
<li>We convince them to instead praise Shenron Barney Targeryn V <img src="/DnD-notes/./assets/images/shenron.png" alt="Shenron Barney Targeryn V"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We tell Reidoth that the dragon might terrorize neighboring villages now that the cultists are leaving
<ul>
<li>He becomes worries and decides to talk to Iarno about it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>He gives us a map of Wave Echo cave</strong></li>
<li>We ask if there's a witch nearby...
<ul>
<li>Agatha is a with that lives 1 hour south, near Connyberry  Village</li>
<li>Agatha is introverted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We decide to talk to the dragon, Venomfang
<ul>
<li>Sildar gets frustrated that we've abandoned the main mission (lol) and leaves before we confront Venomfang</li>
<li>We convince Venomfang to try to go to Neverwinter for more riches, but he still wants to eat us...</li>
<li>We lure him outside, telling him he can eat Akta's arm instead of eating us</li>
<li><span style="color:red">Akta feigns cutting off his arm twice, attempting to attack Venomfang, but misses both times</span>
<ul>
<li>Venomfang attacks us</li>
<li>Mid-combat, Iarno, Reidoth, and Sildar arrive to help</li>
<li>We slay Venomfang!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since we slayed Venomfang, we were told where Wave Echo cave is
<ul>
<li><em>Everyone</em> now knows where Wave Echo cave is, including Iarno</li>
<li>Technically, we don't need to save Gundren anymore, we can just go straight to Wave Echo cave, since our summoner is Korvac</li>
<li>We decide to go to Connyberry first</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Arrive at 20:00 -- it's foggy</li>
<li>We see the entrance of her home: a hole in a tree with a lantern outside
<ul>
<li>Emerit aggressively rolls a Rock of Yondallah into the opening</li>
<li>Akta whispers "Agatha" towards the opening, and the fog grows colder around us, but no one comes out</li>
<li>Emerit throws paper airplane made of Pamphlet of Researchtology through the opening, which flies in but disappears</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The witch comes out with the paper airplane in her hand then burns it
<ul>
<li>She sees the Dendrar's Silver Crown on Akta's head and asks him if he's a descendant of a Dendrar</li>
<li>She eventually takes the crown off Akta's head</li>
<li>Akta asks for information before letting her keep the crown</li>
<li>She says: "I made a pact so that in exchange for the crown, I'll help the Dendrar family as much as I can"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We ask her for 6000 GP
<ul>
<li>She instead offers to tell us about Wave Echo cave, but we already know about it
<ul>
<li>She then realizes that we're foreigners and tells us we can't use the money in the cave because we'd need to mine it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We start asking her about the Black Spider, but she refuses to give info without the crown or Mirna</li>
<li>We contemplate killing her, so we ask how strong she is
<ul>
<li>She says that she's weaker than Venomfang, she thinks she <em>may be able to</em> kill Iarno</li>
<li><strong>We ask her why she wouldn't want to kill Iarno, and she says: "What's the point in killing a puppet?"</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We eventually agree to get Mirna and give it to her so she can break the pact without us having to give her the crown
<ul>
<li>But we have to leave her with Gondorf and the crown</li>
<li>Gondorf learns a new spell in the meantime</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We bring her Mirna
<ul>
<li>She demands we ask her our question now... We ask: "Tell us everything about the Black Spider?"
<ul>
<li>His name is Neznar</li>
<li>He's a drow</li>
<li>He leads a band of elves who are seeking to take over Wave Echo cave</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The witch shrivels up and turns into dust
<ul>
<li>The fog lifts from the forest</li>
<li><em>Essentially, Agatha was a banshee (already dead) and her pact with the Dendrars were keeping her in this world, so breaking the pact with Mirna allowed her to die</em></li>
<li><em>We get to keep the 5000 GP crown and Mirna, yay :)</em></li>

<li>Korvac wants to save Gundren, but Sildar doesn't care about him anymore</li>
<li>We ask: "Korvac, how would you feel if we go straight to Wave Echo cave?"</li>
<li>Tim convinces them to save Gundren by saying Gundren will give them the riches from Wave Echo cave</li>
<li>Before heading to Cragmaw Castle, we go to see Iarno
<ul>
<li>Thanks us for helping with the dragon, offers us stuff in exchange for our services</li>
<li>Offers us gold (1500 each), or new spells, or potions
<ul>
<li><em>Hildebrand buys Summon Elemental from me for 100 GP</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We head to Cragmaw Castle with Sildar</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cragmaw-castle">Cragmaw Castle<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cragmaw-castle"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We see muddy footsteps leading up the stairs and through entryway, with dried blood -- looks like someone was dragged</li>
<li>A drow spots us and tells us to leave, tells us Gundren isn't here
<ul>
<li>We show the drow the Glass Staff, but he doesn't recognize it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We decide to just go around the building on the south side
<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">We encounter some goblins and kill them</span></li>
<li><em>We Long Rest</em></li>
<li><span style="color:red">Kill some drows</span> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lockpick next door, found Gundren and Jarvani!</strong></li>
<li>We encounter a bugbear, but we convince him to take us to his King</li>
<li>We overhear a drow threatening the king with a weapon, the conversation:
<ul>
<li>Goblins had made a deal with the drow to kidnap Gundren</li>
<li>Drow now asking for Gundren, but King Goblin wants more in exchange</li>
<li>But drow is refusing, now wanna kill King Goblin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We attempt to lead the bugbear out of the castle, but he insists to bring the King out to us instead
<ul>
<li>Drow offers to deal with us in the King's stead, and King says he'll let the drow "have the dwarf [Gundren]" if the drow takes care of the situation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color:red">Drow and bugbear come out to greet us all, see us with Gundren, and decide to attack us</span> 
<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">We knock the drow out unconscious and the bugbear surrenders</span></li>
<li>We rip the bugbear's tongue out </li>
<li>We find a note on the drow: 
<ul>
<li>There's a stamp at the bottom that looks like a spider</li>
<li>"Bring Gundren to this location: <em>picture of Wave Echo cave</em>"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We interrogate the drow, and we learn:
<ul>
<li>Black Spider is maybe at Wave Echo cave</li>
<li>Drow doesn't know why they need Gundren at Wave Echo cave</li>
<li>He knows the Black Spider seeks "something" at Wave Echo cave</li>
<li>He conjures up an image of what the Black Spider looks like, and tells us he uses drow weapons and to be wary of the "spider staff", which is poisonous</li>
<li>The Black Spider's weakness is that "he has no mercy for his victims"</li>
<li>Apparently, Iarno and Black Spider have a deal with Iarno leaves alone the Red Brand Ruffians, and in return Iarno gets sole ownership of WEC
<ul>
<li>RBR's purpose is to get the supplies to excavate WEC</li>
<li>Iarno broke the agreement by hiring us</li>
<li>He doesn't know why BS is offering Iarno WEC</li>
<li>Sildar is confused about things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BS is stronger than Iarno</li>
<li>BS is a warrior class</li>
<li>Not sure if BS is alone in WEC</li>
<li>Drow is BS's right-hand man</li>
<li>RBRs need to stay in Phandalen</li>
</ul>
</li>
