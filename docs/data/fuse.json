In exchange, he asks us to convince the cultists here to leave the nearby tower\r\n        - They are dragon-worshippers that keep giving gifts to the dragon that lives in the tower in the east\r\n        - They wear black masks and cloaks\r\n        - If we drive the dragon away or kill it, we get to keep the loot\r\n- Phandelver's Pact\r\n    - It's the agreement to share Wave Echo cave, which has unlimited minerals to mine between the humans, elves, etc.\r\n    - He knows where it is (and it's the cave Gundren is looking for)\r\n- We decide to look around the area...\r\n    - **We find Dendrar's Silver Crown, Mirna's family's heirloom, worth 5000 GP**\r\n        - **It can be given to a witch nearby for a favor**\r\n- We encounter the cultists\r\n    - We convince them to instead praise Shenron Barney Targeryn V ![Shenron Barney Targeryn V](./assets/images/shenron.png)\r\n- We tell Reidoth that the dragon might terrorize neighboring villages now that the cultists are leaving\r\n    - He becomes worries and decides to talk to Iarno about it\r\n- **He gives us a map of Wave Echo cave**\r\n- We ask if there's a witch nearby...\r\n    - Agatha is a with that lives 1 hour south, near Connyberry  Village\r\n    - Agatha is introverted\r\n- We decide to talk to the dragon, Venomfang\r\n    - Sildar gets frustrated that we've abandoned the main mission (lol) and leaves before we confront Venomfang\r\n    - We convince Venomfang to try to go to Neverwinter for more riches, but he still wants to eat us...\r\n    - We lure him outside, telling him he can eat Akta's arm instead of eating us\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Akta feigns cutting off his arm twice, attempting to attack Venomfang, but misses both times</span>\r\n        - Venomfang attacks us\r\n        - Mid-combat, Iarno, Reidoth, and Sildar arrive to help\r\n        - We slay Venomfang!\r\n- Since we slayed Venomfang, we were told where Wave Echo cave is\r\n    - *Everyone* now knows where Wave Echo cave is, including Iarno\r\n    - Technically, we don't need to save Gundren anymore, we can just go straight to Wave Echo cave, since our summoner is Korvac\r\n    - We decide to go to Connyberry first\r\n\r\n## Connyberry\r\n- Arrive at 20:00 -- it's foggy\r\n- We see the entrance of her home: a hole in a tree with a lantern outside\r\n    - Emerit aggressively rolls a Rock of Yondallah into the opening\r\n    - Akta whispers \"Agatha\" towards the opening, and the fog grows colder around us, but no one comes out\r\n    - Emerit throws paper airplane made of Pamphlet of Researchtology through the opening, which flies in but disappears\r\n- The witch comes out with the paper airplane in her hand then burns it\r\n    -

She says: \"I made a pact so that in exchange for the crown, I'll help the Dendrar family as much as I can\"\r\n- We ask her for 6000 GP\r\n    - She instead offers to tell us about Wave Echo cave, but we already know about it\r\n        - She then realizes that we're foreigners and tells us we can't use the money in the cave because we'd need to mine it\r\n- We start asking her about the Black Spider, but she refuses to give info without the crown or Mirna\r\n- We contemplate killing her, so we ask how strong she is\r\n    - She says that she's weaker than Venomfang, she thinks she *may be able to* kill Iarno\r\n    - **We ask her why she wouldn't want to kill Iarno, and she says: \"What's the point in killing a puppet?\"**\r\n- We eventually agree to get Mirna and give it to her so she can break the pact without us having to give her the crown\r\n    - But we have to leave her with Gondorf and the crown\r\n    - Gondorf learns a new spell in the meantime\r\n- We bring her Mirna\r\n    - She demands we ask her our question now... We ask: \"Tell us everything about the Black Spider?\"\r\n        - His name is Neznar\r\n        - He's a drow\r\n        - He leads a band of elves who are seeking to take over Wave Echo cave\r\n- The witch shrivels up and turns into dust\r\n    - The fog lifts from the forest\r\n    - *Essentially, Agatha was a banshee (already dead) and her pact with the Dendrars were keeping her in this world, so breaking the pact with Mirna allowed her to die*\r\n    - *We get to keep the 5000 GP crown and Mirna, yay :)*\r\n\r\n## Return to Phandalen\r\n- Korvac wants to save Gundren, but Sildar doesn't care about him anymore\r\n- We ask: \"Korvac, how would you feel if we go straight to Wave Echo cave?\"\r\n- Tim convinces them to save Gundren by saying Gundren will give them the riches from Wave Echo cave\r\n- Before heading to Cragmaw Castle, we go to see Iarno\r\n    - Thanks us for helping with the dragon, offers us stuff in exchange for our services\r\n    - Offers us gold (1500 each), or new spells, or potions\r\n        - *Hildebrand buys Summon Elemental from me for 100 GP*\r\n- We head to Cragmaw Castle with Sildar\r\n\r\n## Cragmaw Castle\r\n- We see muddy footsteps leading up the stairs and through entryway, with dried blood -- looks like someone was dragged\r\n- A drow spots us and tells us to leave, tells us Gundren isn't here\r\n    - We show the drow the Glass Staff, but he doesn't recognize it\r\n- We decide to just go around the building on the south side\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">We encounter some goblins and kill them</span>\r\n    - *We Long Rest*\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Kill some drows</span> \r\n- **Lockpick next door, found Gundren and Jarvani!**\r\n- We encounter a bugbear, but we convince him to take us to his King\r\n- We overhear a drow threatening the king with a weapon, the conversation:\r\n    - Goblins had made a deal with the drow to kidnap Gundren\r\n    - Drow now asking for Gundren, but King Goblin wants more in exchange\r\n    - But drow is refusing, now wanna kill King Goblin\r\n- We attempt to lead the bugbear out of the castle, but he insists to bring the King out to us instead\r\n    - Drow offers to deal with us in the King's stead, and King says he'll let the drow \"have the dwarf [Gundren]\" if the drow takes care of the situation\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Drow and bugbear come out to greet us all, see us with Gundren, and decide to attack us</span> \r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">We knock the drow out unconscious and the bugbear surrenders\r\n    - We rip the bugbear's tongue out</span> \r\n    - We find a note on the drow: \r\n        - There's a stamp at the bottom that looks like a spider\r\n        - \"Bring Gundren to this location: *picture of Wave Echo cave*\"\r\n- We interrogate the drow, and we learn:\r\n    - Black Spider is maybe at Wave Echo cave\r\n    - Drow doesn't know why they need Gundren at Wave Echo cave\r\n    - He knows the Black Spider seeks \"something\" at Wave Echo cave\r\n    - He conjures up an image of what the Black Spider looks like, and tells us he uses drow weapons and to be wary of the \"spider staff\", which is poisonous\r\n    - The Black Spider's weakness is that \"he has no mercy for his victims\"\r\n    - Apparently, Iarno and Black Spider have a deal with Iarno leaves alone the Red Brand Ruffians, and in return Iarno gets sole ownership of WEC\r\n        - RBR's purpose is to get the supplies to excavate WEC\r\n        - Iarno broke the agreement by hiring us\r\n        - He doesn't know why BS is offering Iarno WEC\r\n        - Sildar is confused about things\r\n    - BS is stronger than Iarno\r\n    - BS is a warrior class\r\n    - Not sure if BS is alone in WEC\r\n    - Drow is BS's right-hand man\r\n    - RBRs need to stay in Phandalen\r\n","n":0.027}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tutorial","n":1},"1":{"v":"\r\nWelcome to Dendron!
