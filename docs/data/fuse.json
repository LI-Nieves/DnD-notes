We'll be meeting with someone who will tell us the main quest\r\n\r\n## Delivery to Phandalin\r\n- We see 2 horses with black feathers sticking out of it\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Goblin fight</span>\r\n        - We take the last goblin and tie him up, so we can ask it about Gundren and Sildar\r\n        - The Goblin points us in a direction, and *we Short Rest* before going there\r\n- We go in the direction, towards Cragmaw Cave, leaving Korvac behind\r\n\r\n## Cragmaw Cave\r\n- We see remnants of a cart, deducing that Gundren and Sildar were here\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">We fight goblins near the entrance of the cave</span>\r\n- We see wolves chained up\r\n- Erik sneaks past the wolves and sees:\r\n    - Hobgoblin cooking\r\n    - Gundren's provisions\r\n    - More wolves\r\n- We befriend one of the wolves (name her Frizzy) and <span style=\"color:red\">kill the rest</span>\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">We fight the Hobgoblin and his wolves</span>\r\n    - We incapacitate the Hobgoblin and he tells us where Sildar is\r\n    - Pieck kills the Hobgoblin and takes his head\r\n- We go towards Sildar\r\n- We meet another Hobgoblin\r\n    - He offers us Sildar since he give him the other Hobgoblin's head\r\n- **We wake Sildar up and he tells us they took Gundren to Cragmaw Castle**\r\n    - We plan to go to Phandalin to ask if anyone knows where Cragmaw Castle is\r\n\r\n## Phandalin\r\n- We see 40 to 50 log buildings\r\n- Sildar asks us to drop supplies off at Barthen's Provisions\r\n    - Elena Barthen is here and explains our expedition to us...\r\n        - **Apparently, Gundren is the successor of a legendary cave that has infinite treasure**\r\n        - **But no one knows where the cave is, except Gundren claims to have a map to it**\r\n        - Gundren may have been abducted for this knowledge\r\n    - She also recommends we talk to Iarno, the townmaster who helped established the town\r\n- We go to Stone Hill Inn\r\n    - Sildar and Korvac pay for our rooms\r\n    - A patron at the inn says that Iarno is nice and the Redbrand Ruffians (RBRs) have been terrorizing the townspeople\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">We fight some RBRs in the Inn and beat them</span>\r\n        - We ask the last guy who he's working for\r\n        - **As he tries to tell us, he explodes into dust**\r\n    - *We Long Rest*\r\n    - Taryn (the owner of the Inn) tells us that Sildar went to talk to Iarno\r\n    - We go shopping...\r\n- We go to Lionshield Coster\r\n    - Nothing there, the RBRs took everything\r\n    - **The owner, Minghee, tells us that the RBRs are at the Old Owl Well**\r\n    - **Minghee promises us weapons if we get them back from the ruffians**\r\n- We go to Barthen's Provisions\r\n    - We buy potions, caltrops, and rags\r\n- we go to Townmaster's Hall\r\n    - We learn the Iarno used to belong to the Lord's Alliance, a group of powerful people that aims to strengthen small towns\r\n    - **Iarno tells us he'll pay us 100 GP each to deal with the RBRs**\r\n    - **He doesn't know where Cragmaw Castle is, but refers us to a druid at the Ruins of Thunder Tree**\r\n    - We're all generally suspicious of Iarno, ~~so much so that Pieck tried to pickpocket the gold from him and made him mad, so he rescinded the offer~~\r\n\r\n## Old Owl Well\r\n- We see ruins of an old castle\r\n- We trick the guards by saying the RBRs are under attack in Phandalin, so they leave\r\n- Captain of the RBRs comes up to us and allows Pieck and I to come in and see the owl bear\r\n    - Meanwhile, Shadow and Erik are sneaking around\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Captain unleashes owl bear to attack Pieck and I, getting the other RBRs to join the fight</span>\r\n    - Shadow and Erik try to help out\r\n    - We eventually all disengage and befriend the owl bear, baiting him with food\r\n    - We fight again, this time the owl bear fighting the RBRs\r\n    - When I use Tasha's Hideous Laughter on the captain, the grunts flee\r\n    - The grunts who initially left come back and join the combat, eventually losing\r\n    - **Pieck negotiates with the owl bear -- it can join us for one more combat in the campaign**\r\n- **We incapacitate the captain and interrogate him, he tells us:**\r\n    - The weapons are in the well\r\n    - His boss, Glasstaff, is stronger than him\r\n    - His friends explode into dust because they're \"not trusted enough\", but he is\r\n    - Iarno isn't helping them\r\n    - He has over a dozen men in his command\r\n    - The objective of the RBRs is to take over Phandalin, for wealth that was promised to them\r\n    - They stash their gold in the Sleeping Giant\r\n    - He doesn't know who Gundren is\r\n    - Thunder Tree is 1 hour south from here\r\n- **Captain dies before telling us where the secret entrance to the Sleeping Giant is**\r\n    - Owl bear eats him\r\n- **We get 25 GP and a piece of paper from the Captain, that says \"Bring the bag sundown tomorrow. --G\"**\r\n- **We retrieve the bag of Minghee's weapons from the bottom of the well**\r\n\r\n## Back to Phandalin\r\n- Return the weapons to Minghee, then get the rewards\r\n- *We Long Rest at the Inn*\r\n    - We find that Sildar is gone\r\n    - A child named Carp comes in, saying his sister Mirna has been kidnapped by 2 people who then went to Tresendar Manor\r\n\r\n## Tresendar Manor\r\n- We see footprints leading to the cellar, so we follow it there\r\n    - We hear RBRs talking about \"ugly, helpful things\"\r\n    - We see a dungeon through the peephole of the cellar door\r\n- We head out and try to find a secret entrance but fail\r\n- Tim tries to distract them by placing Minor Illusion up the stairs from the cellar\r\n- Nothic comes out to investigate, but failed\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">We fight it and defeat it, then it disappears into the Underdark</span>\r\n- We go into the cellar\r\n- We don't see any people, just sleeping goblins\r\n- We hear rituals happening through the walls\r\n- **We save Mirna and also find Sildar, who just happened to be there too**\r\n    - We tell Sildar to take Mirna back to town\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">We find three cultists that just summoned a Spectator, then fight us</span>\r\n    - **We kill them and each gain 4 GP, except Erik who gains 3 GP**\r\n    - We take the cultist's masks\r\n- *We Short Rest*\r\n- We go back into the main room and pretend to be cultists using the masks we stole, in order to avoid confrontation with the bug bear and goblins\r\n- We eventually find a room with workers, who tells us Glasstaff is in his office next door\r\n    - Since we can't get in the room without the code word, we talk to Glasstaff through the door\r\n    - We convince him to come out by telling him the prisoners escaped\r\n    - He believes us at first, but we go too far and the other workers expose to Glasstaff that we don't know the code word\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Glasstaff deduces we're intruders and fights us with the rest of the workers</span>\r\n    - **We defeat him and interrogate him, revealing...**\r\n        - The mayor isn't in cahoots with them\r\n        - The code word is \"Fear the Black Spider\"\r\n        - He was ordered to make a mess of the place by the Black Spider, who runs everything\r\n        - **He disintegrates before telling us more**\r\n    - **Shadow takes the Glass Staff**\r\n    - **We gain 90 GP and 6 short swords**\r\n- **We go to Glasstaff's office and see his diary**\r\n    - 3 weeks ago:\r\n    > My new name is \"Glasstaff\" \r\n\r\n    > I was tasked to lead the Redbrand Ruffians for Black Spider\r\n    - Few days ago\r\n    > We finally got ahold of the Rockseeker brothers, who are being held in Cragmaw Castle\r\n    \r\n    > We're also looking for the secret cave\r\n- **If you think of the Black Spider's real name, you disintegrate**\r\n    - The guy who disintegrated at Stone Hill Inn knew Black Spider's real name because he was Black Spider's boyfriend -- Black Spider is gay\r\n\r\n## Return to town\r\n- We meet Sildar and Mirna at Stone Hill Inn, and she invites us to her farm for a meal\r\n- At Mirna's farm\r\n    - She makes us rabbit stew and tells us about her family from Thundertree\r\n    - Due to a wizard's mishap (*cough* Iarno *cough*), people from Thundertree turned into zombies\r\n    - Carp's parents were turned into zombies at Thundertree and ate her parents\r\n    - She and Carp escaped the zombies\r\n    - **She offers us her blacksmith family's heirlooms at Thundertree as a reward**\r\n    - Sildar offers Mirna 10 GP, and Akta takes 10 GP from her...\r\n- *We Long Rest* at Stone Hill Inn\r\n- We head to the Sleeping Giant to eliminate the RBRs\r\n    - We tell the grunts that someone left the bag of weapons at Stone Hill Inn\r\n    - A scary drow believes me and leaves the building, heading there\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">**We defeat all the RBRs, 6 total**</span>\r\n- We return to Stone Hill Inn\r\n    - **According to Taryn, the drow just checked for the weapons, didn't find it, then left the city, northbound**\r\n    - *We Long Rest*\r\n- We go to the Townmaster's Hall\r\n    - We show Iarno the head of a RBR and the glass staff\r\n    - **We each get 100 GP for completing his mission** and he offers to buy the glass staff for 1000 GP\r\n        - We try to get him to make a 500 GP down payment while we use it in the meantime\r\n        - He disagrees\r\n    - We disrespect him by placing the head of the RBR on his desk\r\n        - He engulfs it in flames\r\n\r\n## Thundertree\r\n- We all head to Thundertree with Sildar\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Immediately, Ents attack us and get fucked by Emerit</span>\r\n- We meet Reidoth, druid from the Emerald Enclave\r\n    - He watches over Phandalin and warns people who enter this area of the zombies\r\n    - He studied the zombification phenomenon\r\n    - Can fight but prefers not to\r\n- **Reidoth gives us a map of Cragmaw Castle**\r\n    - In exchange, he asks us to convince the cultists here to leave the nearby tower\r\n        - They are dragon-worshippers that keep giving gifts to the dragon that lives in the tower in the east\r\n        - **If we drive the dragon away or kill it, we get to keep the loot**\r\n- He tells us about Phandelver's Pact\r\n    - It's the agreement to share Wave Echo Cave (WEC), which has unlimited minerals to mine between the humans, elves, etc.\r\n    - He knows where it is (and it's the cave Gundren is looking for)\r\n- We decide to look around the area...\r\n    - **We find Dendrar's Silver Crown, Mirna's family's heirloom, worth 5000 GP**\r\n        - **It can be given to a witch nearby for a favor**\r\n- We encounter the cultists\r\n    - We convince them to instead praise Shenron Barney Targeryn V ![Shenron Barney Targeryn V](./assets/images/shenron.png)\r\n- We tell Reidoth that the dragon might terrorize neighboring villages now that the cultists are leaving\r\n    - He becomes worried and decides to talk to Iarno about it\r\n- **He gives us a map of Wave Echo Cave**\r\n- We ask if there's a witch nearby...\r\n    - Agatha is an introverted witch that lives 1 hour south, near Connyberry  Village\r\n- We decide to talk to the dragon, Venomfang\r\n    - Sildar gets frustrated that we've abandoned the main mission (lol) and leaves before we confront Venomfang\r\n    - We convince Venomfang to go to Neverwinter for more riches, but he still wants to eat us...\r\n    - We lure him outside, telling him he can eat Akta's arm instead of eating us\r\n    - Akta feigns cutting off his arm twice, attempting to attack Venomfang, but misses both times\r\n        - <span style=\"color:red\">Venomfang attacks us</span>\r\n        - Mid-combat, Iarno, Reidoth, and Sildar arrive to help\r\n        - We also summon the owl bear to help out\r\n        - **We slay Venomfang!**\r\n- Since we slayed Venomfang, we were told where WEC is\r\n    - *Everyone* now knows where it is, including Iarno\r\n    - Technically, we don't need to save Gundren anymore, we can just go straight to WEC, since our summoner is Korvac\r\n    - We decide to go to Connyberry first\r\n\r\n## Connyberry\r\n- Arrive at 20:00 -- it's foggy\r\n- We see the entrance of her home: a hole in a tree with a lantern outside\r\n    - Emerit throws paper airplane made of Pamphlet of Researchtology through the opening, which flies in but disappears\r\n- The witch comes out with the paper airplane in her hand then burns it\r\n    - She sees the Dendrar's Silver Crown on Akta's head and asks him if he's a descendant of a Dendrar\r\n    - She eventually takes the crown off Akta's head\r\n    - Akta asks for information before letting her keep the crown\r\n    - She says: \"I made a pact so that in exchange for the crown, I'll help the Dendrar family as much as I can\"\r\n- We ask her for 6000 GP\r\n    - She instead offers to tell us about WEC, but we already know about it\r\n        - She then realizes that we're foreigners and tells us we can't use the money in the cave because we'd need to mine it\r\n- We start asking her about the Black Spider, but she refuses to give info without the crown or Mirna\r\n- We contemplate killing her, so we ask how strong she is\r\n    - She says that she's weaker than Venomfang, she thinks she *may be able to* kill Iarno\r\n    - **We ask her why she wouldn't want to kill Iarno, and she says: \"What's the point in killing a puppet?\"**\r\n- We eventually agree to get Mirna and give her to the witch so she can break the pact without us having to give the witch the crown\r\n    - But we have to leave her with Gondorf and the crown\r\n    - Gondorf learns a new spell in the meantime\r\n- We bring her Mirna\r\n    - She demands we ask her our question now... We ask: \"Tell us everything about the Black Spider\"\r\n        - His name is Nezznar\r\n        - He's a drow\r\n        - He leads a band of elves who are seeking to take over WEC\r\n- The witch shrivels up and turns into dust\r\n    - The fog lifts from the forest\r\n    - Essentially, Agatha was a banshee (already dead) and her pact with the Dendrars were keeping her in this world, so breaking the pact with Mirna allowed her to die\r\n    - **We get to keep the 5000 GP crown and Mirna, yay :)**\r\n\r\n## Return to Phandalin\r\n- Korvac wants to save Gundren before going to WEC, but Sildar doesn't care about him anymore\r\n- Tim convinces them to save Gundren by saying Gundren will give them the riches from WEC\r\n- Before heading to Cragmaw Castle, we go to see Iarno\r\n    - Thanks us for helping with the dragon, offers us stuff in exchange for our services\r\n    - **Offers us gold (1500 each), or new spells, or potions**\r\n        - **Hildebrand buys Summon Elemental from me for 100 GP**\r\n- We head to Cragmaw Castle with Sildar\r\n\r\n## Cragmaw Castle\r\n- We see muddy footsteps leading up the stairs and through entryway, with dried blood -- looks like someone was dragged\r\n- A drow spots us and tells us to leave, tells us Gundren isn't here\r\n    - We show the drow the Glass Staff, but he doesn't recognize it\r\n- We decide to just go around the building on the south side\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">We encounter some goblins and kill them</span>\r\n    - *We Long Rest*\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Kill some drows</span> \r\n- **Lockpick next door, found Gundren and Jarvani!**\r\n- We encounter a bugbear and convince him to take us to his King\r\n- We overhear a drow threatening the King with a weapon; the conversation:\r\n    - Goblins had made a deal with the drow to kidnap Gundren\r\n    - Drow is now asking for Gundren, but King Goblin wants more in exchange\r\n    - But drow is refusing to give more, and now wants to just kill King Goblin\r\n- We attempt to lead the bugbear out of the castle, but he insists to bring the King out to us instead\r\n    - Drow offers to deal with us in the King's stead, and King says he'll let the drow \"have the dwarf [Gundren]\" if the drow takes care of the situation\r\n- <span style=\"color:red\">Drow and bugbear come out to greet us all, see us with Gundren, and decide to attack us</span> \r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">We knock the drow out unconscious and the bugbear surrenders\r\n    - We rip the bugbear's tongue out</span> \r\n    - We find a note on the drow: \r\n        - There's a stamp at the bottom that looks like a spider\r\n        - \"Bring Gundren to this location: *picture of WEC*\"\r\n- **We interrogate the drow, and we learn:**\r\n    - Black Spider is maybe at WEC\r\n    - Drow doesn't know why they need Gundren at WEC\r\n    - He knows the Black Spider seeks \"something\" at WEC\r\n    - He conjures up an image of what the Black Spider looks like, and tells us he uses drow weapons and to be wary of the \"spider staff\", which is poisonous\r\n    - The Black Spider's weakness is that \"he has no mercy for his victims\"\r\n    - Apparently, Iarno and Black Spider have a deal -- Iarno leaves alone the RBRs, and in return Iarno gets sole ownership of WEC\r\n        - RBR's purpose is to get the supplies to excavate WEC\r\n        - Iarno broke the agreement by hiring us\r\n        - He doesn't know why BS is offering Iarno WEC\r\n        - Sildar is confused about things\r\n    - BS is stronger than Iarno\r\n    - BS is a warrior class\r\n    - Not sure if BS is alone in WEC\r\n    - Drow is BS's right-hand man\r\n    - RBRs need to stay in Phandalin\r\n- **We kill the drow** and hang him from a tree\r\n- **The King Goblin agrees to help us at WEC**\r\n\r\n## Back to Phandalin to confront Iarno\r\n- We claims to not know the drow, BS, and the plans with the WEC\r\n- He admits that he hired people to be the RBRs, mess up Phandalin, then beat the RBRs to get the respect of the people, so they elect him Townmaster\r\n    - Afterwards, he tried to get rid of the RBRs, but they stopped listening to him\r\n    - Then he hired us to get rid of then\r\n- We threaten to expose him to the townspeople\r\n    - He claims to have leverage, because they won't believe us, and if he kill him then they'll turn on us\r\n- Glasstaff was Iarno's disciple\r\n- \"Were you working with the goblins when you were colluding with the RBRs?\"\r\n    - \"No, and I didn't ask them to kidnap Gundren, and I didn't know about WEC until you told me\"\r\n- He's offering us 15,000 GP to leave him alone\r\n    - He makes Gondorf drink a truth potion and promise to leave him alone after receiving the GP\r\n        - Iarno promises to leave us alone after giving us the GP\r\n- Hildebrand attempts to use Magic Missile on him, but it goes right through him\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">He says \"What a pity\" and the GP we received also disappears, now starting the fight</span>\r\n    - We incapacitate him and tie him up\r\n    - **We dig through his pockets and find 1000 GP and a scroll to teleport to Neverwinter**\r\n- \"Why do you have a scroll to Neverwinter?\"\r\n    - He wanted to run away to Neverwinter if we didn't leave him alone\r\n    - He revealed: if we promised to leave him alone, take the GP, then left, he would've made the GP disappear then teleport to Neverwinter anyway\r\n- **He refuses to give us any more info, so Emerit kills him but pouring a pint of acid dragon blood into his mouth**\r\n\r\n## Post-Iarno fight\r\n- *We Long Rest at Stonehill Inn*\r\n- We hear the patrons + Taryn discussing that there's been a combat in his office and that he has disappeared\r\n    - We assure Taryn he's strong and will probably come back\r\n- We let Sildar know that we're going to WEC, and decide not to take him with us\r\n- We head to Minghee's shop\r\n    - **Akta buys Miner's Pick and Crossbow Bolts**\r\n    - **We sell stuff**\r\n    - Minghee tells us she supports Iarno, but finds that he became townmaster inorganically\r\n- We head to WEC\r\n\r\n## Wave Echo Cave\r\n- We see Nezznar having a conversation with a drow and a dwarf (Nundro Rockseeker)\r\n    - Nezznar asking where Gundren is, because he needs him to navigate the cave\r\n    - Drow reveals that Vyerith is dead\r\n    - RBRs were supposed to summon creatures, according to Nezznar\r\n    - Drow reveals all RBRs are dead\r\n    - Nezznar intends to visit the town\r\n    - Nezznar intends to kill Nundro, preparing a spell to do so, and Nundro pleads for his life\r\n    - Emerit uses Mage Hand to attempt to throw a rock to distract Nezznar\r\n    - Nezznar notices the rock and starts looking for us\r\n- Nezznar encounters Hildebrand, who failed to hide\r\n- Emerit talks to Nundro, who turns out to be Gundren's brother\r\n    - Nundro, Tharden (another dwarf), and Gundren were supposed to go through WEC together\r\n    - Gundren was late, and Nundro and Tharden were captured by Nezznar and tortured; Tharden died \r\n- We agree to help Nezznar navigate the cave\r\n    - **He tells us we're looking for the Forge of Spells, which can enhance weapons**\r\n    -  It's supposedly in the cave but he doesn't know what it looks like\r\n- We reveal to Nezznar that Iarno isn't in Phandalin\r\n    - Nezznar gets excited because Iarno is the reason that he hasn't taken over Phandalin\r\n    - He wants to immediately return to Phandalin and terrorize the villagers\r\n        - Doesn't need the Forge of Spells anymore, because he only needed that to defeat Iarno\r\n    - While trying to keep him from leaving, he gets angry at us and wants to kill us\r\n- Tim tries to convince him to take over a different town, Shenronville\r\n    - He agrees but is still insistent on taking over Phandalin \r\n    - He at least decides to not kill us because we'll \"help him take over Shenronville\"\r\n- Akta tries to show him a \"trick\" with his Lightbringer...\r\n    - <span style=\"color:red\">Akta swings at him, initiating a fight</span>\r\n    - We kill the drow, but **Nezznar escapes with Misty Step and Invisibility**","n":0.016}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tutorial","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\r\nWelcome to Dendron!

Type `dendron` and select `Create New`\r\n\r\n- > NOTE: After you press enter, Dendron will create and open the `dendron` note. Use `<CTRL>-<TAB>` to come back to this note\r\n\r\nYou just created your first note!\r\n\r\n- > NOTE: Notes in Dendron are just plain text markdown with some [frontmatter](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ffec2853-c0e0-4165-a368-339db12c8e4b) on the top. You can edit them in Dendron or using ~~vim~~ your favourite text editor.\r\n\r\n## Find a Note\r\n\r\n1. Use `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to bring up the lookup prompt again\r\n1. Type `dendron` and press `<ENTER>`\r\n\r\n- > TIP: you don't have to type out the entire query, press `<TAB>` to autocomplete\r\n\r\nYou just `looked up` a note!\r\n\r\n- > NOTE: in Dendron, you can find or create notes using the lookup prompt\r\n\r\n## Organize your Notes\r\n\r\n1. Bring up the lookup prompt again\r\n1. Type `tutorial.one`\r\n\r\nYou just created your first hierarchy!\r\n\r\n- > NOTE: hierarchies in Dendron are just `.` delimited files. This makes each note both a file and a folder and makes it easy to keep your notes organized\r\n\r\n- > TIP: You can use the [Dendron Tree View](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hur7r6gr3kqa56s2vme986j) to view your hierarchy. If it's not currently in focus, you can use `CTRL+SHIFT+P`/`CMD+SHIFT+P` to open the command prompt and type in `Dendron: focus on tree view` to make it appear\r\n\r\n## Create a link\r\n\r\n1. In the current note, type `[[` - this should trigger the autocomplete. You can type `one` to narrow it down to the note you just created and hit enter\r\n<!-- Enter '[[' below-->\r\n\r\n<!-- End space-->\r\n\r\nYou just created your first link!\r\n\r\n- > NOTE: the links with the `[[` are called wikilinks (because they were first popularized by Wikipedia)\r\n- > TIP: If you hover your mouse over the link, you can get a preview of the contents inside the note!\r\n\r\n## Navigate a link\r\n\r\n1. Move your text cursor over the link you just created. Hold down `<CTRL>+<ENTER>`/`<CMD>+<ENTER>`\r\n\r\n- > TIP: You can also use `CTRL+CLICK` or `CMD+CLICK` to navigate links via mouse\r\n\r\nYou just navigated the link!\r\n\r\n## Refactor a Note\r\n\r\n1. Open [[tutorial.one]], bring up the command prompt (`CTRL+SHIFT+P`/`CMD+SHIFT+P`) and type `Dendron: Rename Note`\r\n1. Replace `tutorial` with `my-note` and then press `<ENTER>`\r\n1. You just refactored the note!\r\n\r\n- > NOTE: when you rename a note, Dendron updates all links and references of the original note being renamed. Try switching back to [[tutorial]] to see the updated link!\r\n- > TIP: in addition to renaming one note at a time, dendron has [an entire collection](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/srajljj10V2dl19nCSFiC) of refactoring commands that let you change headers, move around sections, and refactor entire hierarchies!\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nCongrats, you finished the Dendron tutorial!\r\n\r\nWas there anything **unclear or buggy** about this tutorial?
