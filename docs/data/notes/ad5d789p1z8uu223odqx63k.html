<li>We go to Stone Hill Inn

<li>His boss, Glasstaff, is stronger than him</li>
<li>His friends explode into dust because they're "not trusted enough", but he is</li>
<li>Iarno isn't helping them</li>
<li>He has over a dozen men in his command</li>
<li>The objective of the RBRs is to take over Phandalin, for wealth that was promised to them</li>
<li>They stash their gold in the Sleeping Giant</li>

<li><strong>If we drive the dragon away or kill it, we get to keep the loot</strong></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>He tells us about Phandelver's Pact
<ul>
<li>It's the agreement to share Wave Echo Cave (WEC), which has unlimited minerals to mine between the humans, elves, etc.</li>
<li>He knows where it is (and it's the cave Gundren is looking for)</li>
</ul>

<li>We decide to look around the area...

<li>We tell Reidoth that the dragon might terrorize neighboring villages now that the cultists are leaving
<ul>
<li>He becomes worried and decides to talk to Iarno about it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>He gives us a map of Wave Echo Cave</strong></li>
<li>We ask if there's a witch nearby...
<ul>
<li>Agatha is an introverted witch that lives 1 hour south, near Connyberry  Village</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We decide to talk to the dragon, Venomfang
<ul>
<li>Sildar gets frustrated that we've abandoned the main mission (lol) and leaves before we confront Venomfang</li>
<li>We convince Venomfang to go to Neverwinter for more riches, but he still wants to eat us...</li>
<li>We lure him outside, telling him he can eat Akta's arm instead of eating us</li>
<li>Akta feigns cutting off his arm twice, attempting to attack Venomfang, but misses both times
<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">Venomfang attacks us</span></li>
<li>Mid-combat, Iarno, Reidoth, and Sildar arrive to help</li>
<li>We also summon the owl bear to help out</li>

</li>
</ul>

<li>Since we slayed Venomfang, we were told where WEC is

<li>Emerit throws paper airplane made of Pamphlet of Researchtology through the opening, which flies in but disappears</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The witch comes out with the paper airplane in her hand then burns it
<ul>
<li>She sees the Dendrar's Silver Crown on Akta's head and asks him if he's a descendant of a Dendrar</li>
<li>She eventually takes the crown off Akta's head</li>
<li>Akta asks for information before letting her keep the crown</li>
<li>She says: "I made a pact so that in exchange for the crown, I'll help the Dendrar family as much as I can"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We ask her for 6000 GP
<ul>
<li>She instead offers to tell us about WEC, but we already know about it
<ul>
<li>She then realizes that we're foreigners and tells us we can't use the money in the cave because we'd need to mine it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We start asking her about the Black Spider, but she refuses to give info without the crown or Mirna</li>
<li>We contemplate killing her, so we ask how strong she is
<ul>
<li>She says that she's weaker than Venomfang, she thinks she <em>may be able to</em> kill Iarno</li>
<li><strong>We ask her why she wouldn't want to kill Iarno, and she says: "What's the point in killing a puppet?"</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We eventually agree to get Mirna and give her to the witch so she can break the pact without us having to give the witch the crown
<ul>
<li>But we have to leave her with Gondorf and the crown</li>
<li>Gondorf learns a new spell in the meantime</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We bring her Mirna

<li>She demands we ask her our question now... We ask: "Tell us everything about the Black Spider"

<li>The Black Spider's weakness is that "he has no mercy for his victims"</li>
<li>Apparently, Iarno and Black Spider have a deal -- Iarno leaves alone the RBRs, and in return Iarno gets sole ownership of WEC

<li>"No, and I didn't ask them to kidnap Gundren, and I didn't know about WEC until you told me"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He's offering us 15,000 GP to leave him alone
<ul>
<li>He makes Gondorf drink a truth potion and promise to leave him alone after receiving the GP
<ul>
<li>Iarno promises to leave us alone after giving us the GP</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hildebrand attempts to use Magic Missile on him, but it goes right through him
<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">He says "What a pity" and the GP we received also disappears, now starting the fight</span></li>
<li>We incapacitate him and tie him up</li>
<li><strong>We dig through his pockets and find 1000 GP and a scroll to teleport to Neverwinter</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Why do you have a scroll to Neverwinter?"
<ul>
<li>He wanted to run away to Neverwinter if we didn't leave him alone</li>
<li>He revealed: if we promised to leave him alone, take the GP, then left, he would've made the GP disappear then teleport to Neverwinter anyway</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>He refuses to give us any more info, so Emerit kills him but pouring a pint of acid dragon blood into his mouth</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><em>We Long Rest at Stonehill Inn</em></li>
<li>We hear the patrons + Taryn discussing that there's been a combat in his office and that he has disappeared
<ul>
<li>We assure Taryn he's strong and will probably come back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We let Sildar know that we're going to WEC, and decide not to take him with us</li>
<li>We head to Minghee's shop
<ul>
<li><strong>Akta buys Miner's Pick and Crossbow Bolts</strong></li>

<h2 id="wave-echo-cave">Wave Echo Cave<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#wave-echo-cave"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We see Nezznar having a conversation with a drow and a dwarf (Nundro Rockseeker)
<ul>
<li>Nezznar asking where Gundren is, because he needs him to navigate the cave</li>
<li>Drow reveals that Vyerith is dead</li>
<li>RBRs were supposed to summon creatures, according to Nezznar</li>
<li>Drow reveals all RBRs are dead</li>
<li>Nezznar intends to visit the town</li>
<li>Nezznar intends to kill Nundro, preparing a spell to do so, and Nundro pleads for his life</li>
<li>Emerit uses Mage Hand to attempt to throw a rock to distract Nezznar</li>
<li>Nezznar notices the rock and starts looking for us</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nezznar encounters Hildebrand, who failed to hide</li>
<li>Emerit talks to Nundro, who turns out to be Gundren's brother
<ul>
<li>Nundro, Tharden (another dwarf), and Gundren were supposed to go through WEC together</li>
<li>Gundren was late, and Nundro and Tharden were captured by Nezznar and tortured; Tharden died </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We agree to help Nezznar navigate the cave
<ul>
<li><strong>He tells us we're looking for the Forge of Spells, which can enhance weapons</strong></li>
<li>It's supposedly in the cave but he doesn't know what it looks like</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We reveal to Nezznar that Iarno isn't in Phandalin
<ul>
<li>Nezznar gets excited because Iarno is the reason that he hasn't taken over Phandalin</li>
<li>He wants to immediately return to Phandalin and terrorize the villagers
<ul>
<li>Doesn't need the Forge of Spells anymore, because he only needed that to defeat Iarno</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While trying to keep him from leaving, he gets angry at us and wants to kill us</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tim tries to convince him to take over a different town, Shenronville
<ul>
<li>He agrees but is still insistent on taking over Phandalin </li>
<li>He at least decides to not kill us because we'll "help him take over Shenronville"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Akta tries to show him a "trick" with his Lightbringer...
<ul>
<li><span style="color:red">Akta swings at him, initiating a fight</span></li>
